#
# Web Document Downloader
#
# This program contains a function to download
# and save the source code of a web document as a local
# file. Given a URL, it downloads the corresponding web
# document as a Unicode character string and saves it to
# a file.  The function also returns the downloaded
# document to the caller as a Python character string.
# NB: The function assumes the source file is encoded as
# UTF-8, which is the case for most HTML/XML documents
# on the web.
#
# Q: Why not just access the web page's source code via
# your favourite web browser (Firefox, Google Chrome, etc)?
#
# A: Because when a Python script requests a web document
# from an online server it may not receive the same file
# you see in your browser!  Many web servers generate
# different HTML/XML code for different clients.  Even
# worse, some web servers may refuse to send documents to
# programs other than standard web browsers.  If a Python
# script requests a web document they may instead respond
# with an "access denied" document!  For instance, try
# viewing the web site http://www.wayofcats.com/blog/ in
# a browser and then try downloading its contents using the
# function below.  Although you can see it in the browser
# it won't be delivered to your Python program!
#
# WARNING: This function will silently overwrite the
# target file if it already exists!
